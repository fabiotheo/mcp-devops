# Multi-line Input Solution for Ink Interface

## Problem
The Ink framework doesn't natively support multi-line text input. When users paste multi-line content, it would appear jumbled with the cursor in the wrong position.

## Solution
Created a custom `MultilineInput` component that properly handles multi-line text.

### Component Features

#### `interface-v2/components/MultilineInput.js`
- **Proper line rendering**: Each line is rendered in its own Box
- **Smart cursor positioning**: Always at the end of the last line
- **Auto-indentation**: Continuation lines are indented by 2 spaces
- **Placeholder support**: Shows help text when input is empty
- **Single/Multi mode**: Optimized rendering for both cases

### Visual Example

Empty state:
```
❯ Type your question...█
```

Single line:
```
❯ This is a single line of text█
```

Multi-line (after paste):
```
❯ First line of text
  Second line of text
  Third line of text█
```

### Integration

The component is integrated in `mcp-ink-cli.mjs`:

```javascript
React.createElement(MultilineInput, {
    value: input,
    onChange: setInput,
    placeholder: 'Type your question...',
    showCursor: true,
    isActive: status === 'ready'
})
```

### Bracketed Paste Mode Support

The main interface handles bracketed paste detection:
1. Detects paste sequences (`[200~` and `\x1b[201~`)
2. Extracts content between markers
3. Converts `\r` to `\n` for proper line breaks
4. Updates input state with multi-line content

### Testing

Test with:
```bash
./test-multiline-elegant.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
MCP_USER=fabio node interface-v2/mcp-ink-cli.mjs
```

Then paste multi-line text and observe proper formatting.

## Implementation Details

- Uses pure JavaScript with `React.createElement` (no JSX)
- Compatible with Ink's rendering model
- Maintains state through React hooks
- Works seamlessly with history navigation

## Benefits

1. **Professional UX**: Clean, intuitive multi-line display
2. **Maintainable**: Modular component design
3. **Extensible**: Easy to add features like line numbers or syntax highlighting
4. **Performance**: Efficient rendering with React reconciliation

This solution provides a production-ready multi-line input experience for CLI applications built with Ink.
